Standards
=========

GeoNode is based on a set of Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards. These standards enable GeoNode installations to be interoperable with a wide variety of tools that support these OGC standards and enable federation with other OGC compliant services and infrastructure. Reference links about these standards are also included at the end of this module.
